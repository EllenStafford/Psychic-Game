**Week 2 Javascript Homework**

Are **YOU** a Psychic? Can **YOU** beat the Computer?
The objective of this homework is to create a game where the
player guesses the letter that the computer has picked.

To play the game:
Press any letter key.
If it matches the computer's choice you win.

You have **9** guesses. Each time you are wrong, you lose a guess.

Guess wrong 9 times and you lose the game.

*After a loss, the game will restart with 9 guesses.*

If you guess correctly, then you **WIN** the game and you get to start
again with 9 guesses.
